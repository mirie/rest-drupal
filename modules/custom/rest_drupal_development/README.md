# Rest Drupal Development Module

## Purpose

This is a development module that contains the custom bundle and assignment 
plugin configurations.

It is meant to be enabled on environments, such a local, where features are
created or updated.

## Other Notes

Currently this bundle configuration feature module only contains:

- bundle name: `rest_drupal`
- It uses the default assignment plugin configurations
- It is not associated with a custom install profile (just uses standard)
